Feraud, R. , Allesarido, R. , Urvoy, T. & Clerot, F.
Random Forest for the Contextual Bandit Problem
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.06952.pdf

The orignal version was only designed for use with binary variables.
Additions have been made to allow for continuous and categorical variables,
and a statistical test has been added to each feature-value split to ensure only statistically significant results are used.
